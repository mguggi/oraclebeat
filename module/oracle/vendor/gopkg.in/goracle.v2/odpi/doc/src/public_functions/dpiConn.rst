.. _dpiConnFunctions:

ODPI-C Public Connection Functions
----------------------------------

Connection handles are used to represent connections to the database. These can
be standalone connections created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_create()` or acquired from a session pool by calling the
function :func:`dpiPool_acquireConnection()`. They can be closed by calling the
function :func:`dpiConn_close()` or releasing the last reference to the
connection by calling the function :func:`dpiConn_release()`. Connection
handles are used to create all handles other than session pools and context
handles.

.. function:: int dpiConn_addRef(dpiConn \*conn)

    Adds a reference to the connection. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the connection needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the connection was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **conn** [IN] -- the connection to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    distributed transaction. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is

    be prepared. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **scrollable** [IN] -- a boolean indicating if the statement is scrollable
    or not. If it is scrollable, :func:`dpiStmt_scroll()` can be used to
    reposition the cursor; otherwise, rows are retrieved in order from the
    statement until the rows are exhausted. This value is ignored for
    statements that do not refer to a query.

    **sql** [IN] -- the SQL that is to be prepared for execution, as a byte
    string in the encoding used for CHAR data. The value can also be NULL if
    the tag parameter is specified.

    execution, in bytes, or 0 if the sql parameter is NULL.

    **tag** [IN] -- the key to be used for searching for the statement in the
    statement cache, as a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. The
    value can also be NULL if the sql parameter is specified.

    **tagLength** [IN] -- the length of the key to be used for searching for
    the statement in the statement cache, in bytes, or 0 if the tag parameter
    is NULL.

    **stmt** [OUT] -- a pointer to a reference to the statement that was just
    prepared, which will be populated upon successful completion of the
    function.

    effect as the SQL statement ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA. The value
    be changed when the next call requiring a round trip to the server is
    performed. If the new schema name does not exist, the same error is
    returned as when the alter session statement is executed. The new schema
