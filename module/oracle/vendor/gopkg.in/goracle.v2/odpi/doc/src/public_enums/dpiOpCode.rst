ODPI-C Public Enumeration dpiOpCode
-----------------------------------

This enumeration identifies the types of operations that can take place during
object change and query change notification. It is used both as a filter when
determining which operations to consider when sending notifications as well as
identifying the operation that took place on a particular table or row when a
notification is sent. Multiple values can be OR'ed together to specify multiple
types of operations at the same time.
