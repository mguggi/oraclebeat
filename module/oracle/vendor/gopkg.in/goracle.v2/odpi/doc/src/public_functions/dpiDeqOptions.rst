ODPI-C Public Dequeue Options Functions
---------------------------------------

Dequeue option handles are used to represent the options specified when
dequeuing messages using advanced queueing. They are created by calling the
function :func:`dpiConn_newDeqOptions()` and are destroyed by releasing the
last reference by calling the function :func:`dpiDeqOptions_release()`.

.. function:: int dpiDeqOptions_addRef(dpiDeqOptions \*options)

    Adds a reference to the dequeue options. This is intended for situations
    where a reference to the dequeue options needs to be maintained
    independently of the reference returned when the handle was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **options** [IN] -- the dequeue options to which a reference is to be
    added. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiDeqOptions_getCondition(dpiDeqOptions \*options, \
        const char \** value, uint32_t \*valueLength)

    Returns the condition that must be satisfied in order for a message to be
    dequeued. See function :func:`dpiDeqOptions_setCondition()` for more
    information.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **options** [IN] -- a reference to the dequeue options from which the
    condition is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error
    is returned.

    **value** [OUT] -- a pointer to the value, as a byte string in the encoding
    used for CHAR data, which will be populated upon successful completion of
    this function. If there is no condition, the pointer will be populated with
    the value NULL.

    **valueLength** [OUT] -- a pointer to the length of the value, in bytes,
    which will be populated upon successful completion of this function. If
    there is no condition, the pointer will be populated with the value 0.


.. function:: int dpiDeqOptions_getConsumerName(dpiDeqOptions \*options, \
        const char \** value, uint32_t \*valueLength)

    Returns the name of the consumer that is dequeuing messages. See function
    :func:`dpiDeqOptions_setConsumerName()` for more information.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **options** [IN] -- a reference to the dequeue options from which the
    consumer name is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **value** [OUT] -- a pointer to the value, as a byte string in the encoding
    used for CHAR data, which will be populated upon successful completion of
    this function. If there is no consumer name, the pointer will be populated
    with the value NULL.

    **valueLength** [OUT] -- a pointer to the length of the value, in bytes,
    which will be populated upon successful completion of this function. If
    there is no consumer name, the pointer will be populated with the value 0.


.. function:: int dpiDeqOptions_getCorrelation(dpiDeqOptions \*options, \
        const char \** value, uint32_t \*valueLength)

    Returns the correlation of the message to be dequeued. See function
    :func:`dpiDeqOptions_setCorrelation()` for more information.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    correlation is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **value** [OUT] -- a pointer to the value, as a byte string in the encoding
    used for CHAR data, which will be populated upon successful completion of
    this function. If there is no correlation, the pointer will be populated
    with the value NULL.

    **valueLength** [OUT] -- a pointer to the length of the value, in bytes,
    which will be populated upon successful completion of this function. If
