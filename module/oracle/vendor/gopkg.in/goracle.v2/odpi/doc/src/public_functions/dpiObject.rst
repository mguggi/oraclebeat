.. _dpiObjectFunctions:

ODPI-C Public Object Functions
------------------------------

Object handles are used to represent instances of the types created by the SQL
command CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE. They are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiObjectType_createObject()` or calling the function
:func:`dpiObject_copy()` or implicitly by creating a variable of the type
DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_OBJECT. The are destroyed when the last reference is released
by calling the function :func:`dpiObject_release()`.

.. function:: int dpiObject_addRef(dpiObject \*obj)

    Adds a reference to the object. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the object needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the object was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiObject_appendElement(dpiObject \*obj, \
        dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*value)

    Sets the value of the element found at the specified index.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object to which the value is to be appended. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise, if the object
    does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    **nativeTypeNum** [IN] -- the native type of the data that is to be
    appended. It should be one of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum<dpiNativeTypeNum>`.

    **value** [IN] -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiData<dpiData>` structure which
    contains the value of the element to append to the collection.


.. function:: int dpiObject_copy(dpiObject \*obj, dpiObject \**copiedObj)

    Creates an independent copy of an object and returns a reference to the
    newly created object. This reference should be released as soon as it is
    no longer needed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object which is to be copied. If the reference is NULL
    or invalid an error is returned.

    **copiedObj** [OUT] -- a pointer to a reference to the object which is
    created as a copy of the first object, which is populated upon successful
    completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiObject_deleteElementByIndex(dpiObject \*obj, \
        int32_t index)

    Deletes an element from the collection. Note that the position ordinals of
    the remaining elements are not changed. The delete operation creates
    *holes* in the collection.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object from which the element is to be deleted. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise, if the object
    does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    **index** [IN] -- the index of the element that is to be deleted. If no
    element exists at that index an error is returned.

        dpiObjectAttr \*attr, dpiNativeTypeNum nativeTypeNum, dpiData \*value)

    Returns the value of one of the object's attributes.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object from which the attribute is to be retrieved. If
    the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **attr** [IN] -- the attribute which is to be retrieved. The attribute must
    belong to the same type as the object; otherwise, an error is returned.

    **nativeTypeNum** [IN] -- the native type of the data that is to be
    retrieved.  It should be one of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiNativeTypeNum<dpiNativeTypeNum>`.

    will be populated with the value of the attribute when this function
    completes successfully.

    **obj** [IN] -- the object for which an element's existence is to be
    tested. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned. Likewise,
    if the object does not refer to a collection an error is returned.

    exists at the specified index (1) or not (0), which will be populated when
