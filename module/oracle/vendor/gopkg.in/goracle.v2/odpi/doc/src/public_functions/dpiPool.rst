.. _dpiPoolFunctions:

ODPI-C Public Pool Functions
----------------------------

Pool handles are used to represent session pools. They are created using the
function :func:`dpiPool_create()` and can be closed by calling the function
:func:`dpiPool_close()` or releasing the last reference to the pool by
calling the function :func:`dpiPool_release()`. Pools can be used to create
connections by calling the function :func:`dpiPool_acquireConnection()`.


.. function:: int dpiPool_acquireConnection(dpiPool \*pool, \
        const char \*userName, uint32_t userNameLength, \
        const char \*password, uint32_t passwordLength, \
        dpiConnCreateParams \*params, dpiConn \**conn)

    Acquires a connection from the pool and returns a reference to it. This
    reference should be released as soon as it is no longer needed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** [IN] -- the pool from which a connection is to be acquired. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **userName** [IN] -- the name of the user used for authenticating the user,
    as a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also
    acceptable if external authentication is being requested or credentials
    were supplied when the pool was created.

    **userNameLength** [IN] -- the length of the userName parameter, in bytes,
    or 0 if the userName parameter is NULL.

    **password** [IN] -- the password to use for authenticating the user, as a
    byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable if
    external authentication is being requested or if credentials were supplied
    when the pool was created.

    **passwordLength** [IN] -- the length of the password parameter, in bytes,
    or 0 if the password parameter is NULL.

    **params** [IN] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiConnCreateParams<dpiConnCreateParams>` structure which is used to
    specify parameters for connection creation. NULL is also acceptable in
    which case all default parameters will be used when creating the
    connection.

    **conn** [OUT] -- a reference to the connection that is acquired from the
    pool. This value is populated upon successful completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiPool_addRef(dpiPool \*pool)

    Adds a reference to the pool. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the pool needs to be maintained independently of the reference
    returned when the pool was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** [IN] -- the pool to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiPool_close(dpiPool \*pool, dpiPoolCloseMode closeMode)

    Closes the pool and makes it unusable for further activity.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **pool** [IN] -- a reference to the pool which is to be closed. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **closeMode** [IN] -- one or more of the values from the enumeration
    :ref:`dpiPoolCloseMode<dpiPoolCloseMode>`, OR'ed together.


.. function:: int dpiPool_create(const dpiContext \*context, \
        const char \*userName, uint32_t userNameLength, \
        const char \*password, uint32_t passwordLength, \
        const char \*connectString, uint32_t connectStringLength, \
        dpiCommonCreateParams \*commonParams, \
        dpiPoolCreateParams \*createParams, dpiPool \**pool)

    Creates a session pool which creates and maintains a group of stateless
    sessions to the database. The main benefit of session pooling is
    performance since making a connection to the database is a time-consuming
    activity, especially when the database is remote.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.
    If a failure occurs, the errorInfo structure is filled in with error
    information.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_create()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an error is
    returned.

    **userName** [IN] -- the name of the user used for authenticating sessions,
    as a byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also
    acceptable if external authentication is being requested or if a
    heterogeneous pool is being created.

    **userNameLength** [IN] -- the length of the userName parameter, in bytes,
    or 0 if the userName parameter is NULL.

    **password** [IN] -- the password to use for authenticating sessions, as a
    byte string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable if
    external authentication is being requested or if a heterogeneous pool is
    being created.

    **passwordLength** [IN] -- the length of the password parameter, in bytes,
    or 0 if the password parameter is NULL.

    **connectString** [IN] -- the connect string identifying the database to
    which connections are to be established by the session pool, as a byte
    string in the encoding used for CHAR data. NULL is also acceptable for
    local connections (identified by the environment variable ORACLE_SID).

    **connectStringLength** [IN] -- the length of the connectString parameter,
    in bytes, or 0 if the connectString parameter is NULL.

    **commonParams** [IN] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiCommonCreateParams<dpiCommonCreateParams>` structure which is used
    to specify context parameters for pool creation. NULL is also acceptable in
    which case all default parameters will be used when creating the pool.

    **createParams** [IN] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiPoolCreateParams<dpiPoolCreateParams>` structure which is used to
    specify parameters for pool creation. NULL is also acceptable in which case
    all default parameters will be used for pool creation.

    **pool** [OUT] -- a reference to the pool that is created. This value will
    be NULL if the creation of the pool structure was completely unsuccessful
    but otherwise will contain a valid handle, even if an error is returned. If
    a value is returned, a call to :func:`dpiPool_release()` must be made in
    order to release the reference.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    sessions is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error
    is returned.

    **value** [OUT] -- a pointer to the value which will be populated upon
    successful completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiPool_getEncodingInfo(dpiPool \*pool, \
        dpiEncodingInfo \*info)

    Returns the encoding information used by the pool. This will be equivalent
    to the values passed when the pool was created, or the values retrieved
    from the environment variables NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR.
