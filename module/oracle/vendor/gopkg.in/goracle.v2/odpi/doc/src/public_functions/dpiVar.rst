.. _dpiVarFunctions:

ODPI-C Public Variable Functions
--------------------------------

Variable handles are used to represent memory areas used for transferring data
to and from the database. They are created by calling the function
:func:`dpiConn_newVar()`. They are destroyed when the last reference to the
variable is released by calling the function :func:`dpiVar_release()`. They are
bound to statements by calling the function :func:`dpiStmt_bindByName()` or the
function :func:`dpiStmt_bindByPos()`. They can also be used for fetching data
from the database by calling the function :func:`dpiStmt_define()`.

.. function:: int dpiVar_addRef(dpiVar \*var)

    Adds a reference to the variable. This is intended for situations where a
    reference to the variable needs to be maintained independently of the
    reference returned when the variable was created.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- the variable to which a reference is to be added. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiVar_copyData(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t pos, \
        dpiVar \*sourceVar, uint32_t sourcePos)

    Copies the data from one variable to another variable.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- the variable into which data is to be copied. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **pos** [IN] -- the array position into which the data is to be copied. The
    first position is 0. If the array position specified exceeds the number of
    elements allocated in the variable, an error is returned.

    **sourceVar** [IN] -- the variable from which is to be copied. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **sourcePos** [IN] -- the array position from which the data is to be
    copied. The first position is 0. If the array position specified exceeds
    the number of elements allocated in the source variable, an error is
    returned.


.. function:: int dpiVar_getData(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t \*numElements, \
        dpiData \**data)

    Returns a pointer to an array of :ref:`dpiData<dpiData>` structures used
    for transferring data to and from the database. These structures are
    allocated by the variable itself and are made available when the variable
    is first created using the function :func:`dpiConn_newVar()`. If a DML
    returning statement is executed, however, the number of allocated elements
    can change in addition to the memory location.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable which contains the data
    structures used for transferring data to and from the database. If the
    reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **numElements** [OUT] -- a pointer to the number of elements that have been
    allocated by the variable, which will be populated when the function
    completes successfully.

    **data** [OUT] -- a pointer to an array of :ref:`dpiData<dpiData>`
    structures which will be populated when the function completes
    successfully.


.. function:: int dpiVar_getNumElementsInArray(dpiVar \*var, \
        uint32_t \*numElements)

    Returns the number of elements in a PL/SQL index-by table if the variable
    was created as an array by the function :func:`dpiConn_newVar()`. If the
    variable is one of the output bind variables of a DML returning statement,
    however, the value returned will correspond to the number of rows returned
    by the DML returning statement. In all other cases, the value returned will
    be the number of elements the variable was created with.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable from which the number of
    elements is to be retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is
    returned.

    **numElements** [OUT] -- a pointer to the number of elements, which will be
    populated when the function completes successfully.


.. function:: int dpiVar_getSizeInBytes(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t \*sizeInBytes)

    Returns the size of the buffer used for one element of the array used for
    fetching/binding Oracle data.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable whose buffer size is to be
    retrieved. If the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.

    **sizeInBytes** [OUT] -- a pointer to the size of the buffer, in bytes,
    which which will be populated when the function completes successfully.


.. function:: int dpiVar_release(dpiVar \*var)

    Releases a reference to the variable. A count of the references to the
    variable is maintained and when this count reaches zero, the memory
    associated with the variable is freed.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- the variable from which a reference is to be released. If
    the reference is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiVar_setFromBytes(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t pos, \
        const char \*value, uint32_t valueLength)

    Sets the variable value to the specified byte string. In the case of the
    variable's Oracle type being DPI_ORACLE_TYPE_NUMBER, the byte string is
    converted to an Oracle number during the call to this function.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid, an error is returned. If the variable does
    not use native type DPI_NATIVE_TYPE_BYTES, an error is returned.

    **pos** [IN] -- the array position in the variable which is to be set. The
    first position is 0. If the position exceeds the number of elements
    allocated by the variable an error is returned.

    **value** [IN] -- a pointer to the byte string which contains the data to
    be set. The data is copied to the variable buffer and does not need to be
    retained after this function call has completed.

    **valueLength** [IN] -- the length of the data to be set, in bytes.


.. function:: int dpiVar_setFromLob(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t pos, dpiLob \*lob)

    Sets the variable value to the specified LOB.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned.

    **pos** [IN] -- the array position in the variable which is to be set. The
    first position is 0. If the position exceeds the number of elements
    allocated by the variable an error is returned.

    **lob** [IN] -- a reference to the LOB which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned. A reference is retained
    by the variable until a new value is set or the variable itself is freed.


.. function:: int dpiVar_setFromObject(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t pos, \
        dpiObject \*obj)

    Sets the variable value to the specified object.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **var** [IN] -- a reference to the variable which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned.

    **pos** [IN] -- the array position in the variable which is to be set. The
    first position is 0. If the position exceeds the number of elements
    allocated by the variable an error is returned.

    **obj** [IN] -- a reference to the object which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned. A reference is retained
    by the variable until a new value is set or the variable itself is freed.

    allocated by the variable an error is returned.

    **stmt** [IN] -- a reference to the rowid which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned. A reference is retained
    by the variable until a new value is set or the variable itself is freed.


.. function:: int dpiVar_setFromStmt(dpiVar \*var, uint32_t pos, \
        dpiStmt \*stmt)

    Sets the variable value to the specified statement.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    allocated by the variable an error is returned.

    **stmt** [IN] -- a reference to the statement which should be set. If the
    reference is null or invalid an error is returned. A reference is retained
    by the variable until a new value is set or the variable itself is freed.


.. function:: int dpiVar_setNumElementsInArray(dpiVar \*var, \
        uint32_t numElements)

    Sets the number of elements in a PL/SQL index-by table.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.
